### What is this repository for? ###

The Project Service is a micro framework for managing local sandboxed project environments in a users account. The idea is to completely work in the userspace and that projects should not interfere with each other (e.g. no shared database server).

The developer can start all required services on demand and shut them down if not needed anymore. On top of that it is possible to execute other interesting tasks for easier local development (e.g. creating a project setup routine for downloading live data and installing it on the local machine).
